## Style and Design

*   **Color Palette:**
    *   Main Background: A soft, earthy green.
    *   Secondary Background: A light peach/pink.
    *   Text: Dark grey/black.
    *   Accent: A warm orange for buttons.
*   **Typography:** A clean, modern sans-serif font will be used for readability.
*   **Imagery:** High-quality images related to yoga, nature, and wellness will be used throughout the site.
*   **Layout:** A responsive, single-page layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Features

*   **Header:** A welcoming header with a title and an inspiring image.

3.  **Create `main.js`:**

    *   Define the custom element.
4.  **Populate Content:**
    *   Integrate the `<yoga-card>` components into the HTML.
    *   Add text and find suitable, license-free images for the page.
    *   Use a placeholder for the map.
